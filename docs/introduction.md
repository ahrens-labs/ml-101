# Introduction
Welcome to the wonderful world of machine learning!

## What is Machine Learning?
Machine learning is a type of artificial intelligence (AI) that allows computers to learn from data without being explicitly programmed. Think about how you learn. You learn from experience. If you see a few dogs, you start to understand what a dog looks like. If you touch a hot stove, you learn to not do it again.

Machine learning works in a similar way. We feed a computer a lot of data (like pictures of dogs) and it learns to recognize patterns in that data. The more data it sees, the better it gets at its task.

## Why learn about machine learning?
Machine learning is all around us! It's the technology that powers:
- **Recommendation engines:** When Netflix suggests a movie you might like, or when Amazon recommends a product, that's machine learning at work.
- **Spam filters:** Your email service uses machine learning to figure out which emails are junk and which are important.
- **Voice assistants:** When you talk to Siri, Alexa, or Google Assistant, they use machine learning to understand what you're saying.
- **Self-driving cars:** These cars use machine learning to understand their surroundings and make decisions.

By learning about machine learning, you'll have a better understanding of the technology that is shaping our world. You'll also be able to build your own amazing things!

## Where weâ€™re headed
In this course, we'll start with the basics and build our way up. Here's a quick look at what we'll cover:
- **Lesson 1: Definitions:** We'll learn the basic vocabulary of machine learning.
- **Lesson 2: Categories of ML:** We'll explore the different types of machine learning.
- **Lesson 3: The ML Process:** We'll learn about the steps involved in building a machine learning model.
- **Lessons 4-8: Building Models:** We'll get our hands dirty and build our own machine learning models using Python. We'll cover Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, K-Nearest Neighbors, and K-Means Clustering.

By the end of this course, you'll have a solid foundation in machine learning and you'll be ready to start exploring this exciting field on your own.
